## Q1. Which opening line works better for creating a workout plan?

**Options:**
A. "Create a 30-minute workout plan for beginners"
B. "Do you know anything about exercise?"
C. "I was wondering about workouts and fitness stuff"
D. "What kind of workout should I do?"

**Correct Answer: A**

**Reasoning:** Option A follows the **_"clear and direct"_** principle by using an action verb ("Create") and specifying exactly what's needed (30-minute workout for beginners). The other options are vague, indirect, or ask questions instead of giving clear instructions.

## Q2. How to fix Claude missing sarcastic comments in social media analysis?

**Options:**
A. Ask it to guess when something might be sarcastic
B. Provide examples showing sarcastic posts labeled as negative
C. Tell it to "be more careful about sarcasm"
D. Make the prompt longer with more instructions

**Correct Answer: B**

**Reasoning:** Providing labeled examples **_"(one-shot or multi-shot prompting)"_** is an effective technique for teaching AI to recognize patterns like sarcasm. Vague instructions like "be more careful" or asking it to "guess" are not specific enough, and simply making prompts longer doesn't necessarily address the core issue.

## Q3. What is prompt engineering?

**Options:**
A. Training AI models on new datasets
B. Improving a prompt to get more reliable, higher-quality outputs
C. Programming AI models from scratch using code
D. Building the hardware infrastructure for AI systems

**Correct Answer: B**

**Reasoning:** Prompt engineering is specifically about crafting and refining input prompts to elicit better responses from AI models, not about training models, programming from scratch, or hardware infrastructure.

## Q4. "Providing sample input/output pairs to guide AI responses" describes which technique?

**Options:**
A. Being clear and direct
B. Iterative refinement
C. XML structuring
D. One-shot or multi-shot prompting

**Correct Answer: D**

**Reasoning:** One-shot (single example) or multi-shot (multiple examples) prompting involves providing example input/output pairs to demonstrate the desired response format and style to the AI.

## Q5. What is the main purpose of using XML tags in prompts?

**Options:**
A. To reduce the token count of prompts
B. To increase the processing speed of AI models
C. To add structure and clarity, especially when including large amounts of content
D. To make prompts look more professional

**Correct Answer: C**

**Reasoning:** XML tags (like `<question>`, `<context>`, `<instructions>`) help organize and structure prompts, making it easier for the AI to parse different sections, especially when dealing with complex or lengthy content.
