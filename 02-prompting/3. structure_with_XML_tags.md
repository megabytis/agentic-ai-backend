## Prompt Engineering Technique #3 **Structure with XML Tags**

### Problem

When a prompt contains:

- interpolated variables
- long text blobs
- multiple data sources

the model can’t reliably tell:

- what is input vs instruction
- what belongs to what
- what should be analyzed

It guesses. Guessing = unstable scores.

## Solution: Wrap Content in XML Tags

Use **made-up semantic tags** to label sections.

Example:

```xml
<athlete_info>
  Height: 185
  Weight: 90
  Goal: Muscle Gain
  Dietary restrictions: Gluten-Free
</athlete_info>
```

There is no “real” XML schema.
We are just giving the model **visual boundaries + meaning**.

---

## Why It Works

XML tags:

- create **clear content boundaries**
- disambiguate roles (input vs context vs task)
- improve parsing reliability
- raise eval stability

This matters **most** when:

- inputs are long
- multiple data blocks exist
- you pass logs, docs, records, transcripts, etc.

## Rule to Keep

> Any non-trivial input block must be wrapped in semantic tags.

Use tags whenever:

- you paste text
- you pass structured data
- you mix instructions + content
