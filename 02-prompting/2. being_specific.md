## Prompt Engineering Technique #2: **Be Specific**

### Problem

Vague prompts → unpredictable output
Model chooses:

- length
- structure
- missing info
- random style

You lose control.

---

## Two Ways to Be Specific

### Type A — **Guidelines (Output Attributes)**

You tell the model _what the output must look like_.

Examples:

- Limit length
- Force structure
- Require certain sections
- Enforce constraints

This **raises consistency** and **score stability**.

---

### Type B — **Steps (Reasoning Process)**

You tell the model _how to think_.

Examples:

1. Calculate calories
2. Determine macros
3. Build meals
4. Verify restrictions

This helps with **complex logic**, but can sometimes reduce creativity or score.

---

## Rule to Keep

> Always add **Guidelines**.
> Add **Steps only when logic is complex.**

### Example :--

```text
Generate a one-day meal plan for an athlete that strictly follows their dietary restrictions.

Inputs:
- Height (cm): {{height_cm}}
- Weight (kg): {{weight_kg}}
- Goal: {{goal}}
- Dietary restrictions: {{dietary_restrictions}}

Guidelines:
- Include estimated daily calories
- Provide macro breakdown (protein, carbs, fats in grams)
- Use realistic portion sizes
- Meals must be practical and repeatable
- Use only foods that match the dietary restriction
- No medical claims
- No emojis
- No explanations

Steps:
1. Estimate daily calorie target from height, weight, and goal
2. Split calories into protein, carbs, and fats
3. Design meals to match those macros
4. List meals in chronological order

Output format:
- Daily calories
- Macros (g)
- Meal 1 … Meal N with foods + portions only

```
