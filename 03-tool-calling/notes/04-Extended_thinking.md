## Extended Thinking

**What it is:** Gives the model time to "think" internally before answering, showing its reasoning process.

**When to use:** Complex math, logic puzzles, coding, multi-step reasoning where accuracy matters more than speed.

**Trade-offs:**

- ✅ More accurate for complex tasks
- ❌ Slower responses (latency)
- ❌ Uses more tokens (cost)

**_But...But...But..._**

**The truth:** True "thinking capability" (like Claude's extended thinking or DeepSeek R1's reasoning) is **built into the model by the producer**. We can't add it manually.

**What you CAN do manually (prompt engineering):**

- Ask the model to "think step by step"
- Break down complex problems
- Show reasoning in the response

**But this is NOT the same as:**

- Claude's internal thinking tokens (with signatures)
- DeepSeek R1's hidden reasoning
- Special API parameters that trigger model-level thinking
