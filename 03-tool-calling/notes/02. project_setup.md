# **Project: model Reminder System**

## **🎯 Project Goal**

Build model-powered reminder system with 3 tools:

1. **Current time tool** → Get exact datetime
2. **Date calculator tool** → Add time periods
3. **Reminder setter tool** → Schedule actual reminders

---

## **🚨 The 3 Challenges**

### **Challenge 1: model Doesn't Know Exact Time**

> "Set a reminder for 24 hours from now"
> ❌ model: Doesn't know current hour/minute

### **Challenge 2: Date Math Can Fail**

> "379 days from January 13, 1973"
> ❌ model: Sometimes gets date math wrong

### **Challenge 3: No Reminder Mechanism**

❌ model: Knows what reminders ARE but can't set them

---

## **🛠️ 3 Tools We'll Build**

### **Tool 1: `get_current_datetime()`**

**Purpose:** Give model exact current time

```
Input: None
Output: "2024-01-15 14:30:00"
```

### **Tool 2: `add_to_datetime(base, duration)`**

**Purpose:** Accurate date calculations

```
Input: "2024-01-15", "+7 days"
Output: "2024-01-22 14:30:00"
```

### **Tool 3: `set_reminder(time, message)`**

**Purpose:** Actually schedule reminders

```
Input: "2024-01-22 09:00", "Doctor appointment"
Output: "Reminder set!"
```

## **🧠 model's Capabilities/Limits**

### **✅ model CAN:**

- Know current date
- Understand "reminder" concept
- Parse natural language dates

### **❌ model CAN'T:**

- Know exact time (hour/minute)
- Always do perfect date math
- Actually set reminders (needs your code)

---

## **📝 Example User Request**

```
User: "Set a reminder for my doctor's appointment, it's a week from Thursday"

Flow:
1. model uses Tool 1 → Gets current datetime
2. model uses Tool 2 → Calculates "week from Thursday"
3. model uses Tool 3 → Sets reminder at calculated time
4. Output: "Okay, I will remind you at that time!"
```

---

## **⚙️ Technical Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Basic Setup**

```python
1. Import libraries (datetime, etc.)
2. Define tool functions
3. Set up model connection
```

### **Phase 2: Tool Integration**

```python
# Tell model about tools
tools = [
    get_current_datetime,
    add_to_datetime,
    set_reminder
]
```

### **Phase 3: Testing**

```python
# Test cases:
1. "What time is it now?" → Tool 1
2. "What's 20 days from today?" → Tool 1 + 2
3. "Remind me tomorrow" → All 3 tools
```
