# **Tool Use in AI**

## **🚀 The Core Problem: model's Limitations**

### **The Challenge**

> "model only has access to information it was trained on"

**Example:**

```
User: "What's the weather in San Francisco right now?"
model: ❌ "I don't have access to up-to-date weather information"
```

**Why?** model's knowledge has a **cutoff date** - it can't access real-time data.

## **🛠️ The Solution: Tool Use**

### **Simple Analogy: model as a Librarian**

**Without Tools:**

> You ask librarian: "What's today's news?"
> Librarian: "I only have books up to 2023"

**With Tools:**

> You ask librarian: "What's today's news?"
> Librarian: "Let me check the newspaper" (uses tool)
> Gives you current news ✅

---

## **🔄 The Tool Use Flow (Step-by-Step)**

### **Step 1: Initial Request**

You send model:

1. User's question/prompt
2. List of available tools with their schemas

```
"User: What's the weather in SF?
Available tools: get_weather(location)"
```

### **Step 2: model's Decision**

model analyzes:

- "Do I need external data to answer?"
- "Which tool should I use?"

**Output:** "I need to use `get_weather('San Francisco')`"

### **Step 3: Your Code Runs**

Your server:

1. Receives model's tool request
2. Calls actual weather API
3. Gets real data

```
API Call → Weather.com → Returns: "72°F, Sunny"
```

### **Step 4: Follow-up Request**

You send back to model:

1. Original question
2. **Tool result**: "72°F, Sunny"

### **Step 5: Final Response**

model now has everything:

- Original question
- **Real-time data** from tool

**Final Answer:** "It's currently 72°F and sunny in San Francisco!"

## **🔧 Types of Tools model Can Use**

### **1. Information Retrieval Tools**

- Weather APIs
- Stock prices
- News feeds
- Sports scores

### **2. Calculation/Processing Tools**

- Calculators
- Unit converters
- Data analyzers

### **3. Action/Execution Tools**

- Send emails
- Calendar updates
- Database queries

---

## **💡 Real-World Examples**

### **Example 1: Stock Inquiry**

```
User: "What's Apple's current stock price?"

Flow:
1. You: "Here's stock_check tool"
2. model: "Use stock_check('AAPL')"
3. Your code: Calls financial API → "$182.50"
4. model: "Apple is trading at $182.50"
```

### **Example 2: Travel Planning**

```
User: "Find flights from NYC to Paris next week"

Flow:
1. You: "Here's flight_search tool"
2. model: "Use flight_search('NYC', 'Paris', dates)"
3. Your code: Calls flight API → gets options
4. model: "Here are 3 flights starting at $650"
```

## **🎯 Key Benefits of Tool Use**

### **1. Access to Real-Time Data**

- Weather, stocks, news
- Breaking information
- Current events

### **2. Specialized Knowledge**

- Your company data
- Private databases
- Proprietary information

### **3. Computational Power**

- Complex calculations
- Data processing
- External analyses

---

## **🚫 What Tools CAN'T Do**

### **Limitations:**

1. **model doesn't execute tools directly** - YOU write the code
2. **Tools need to be explicitly defined** - model won't invent new ones
3. **Security is YOUR responsibility** - Validate tool inputs

---

## **📝 Implementation Checklist**

### **To Add Tool Use:**

1. **Define available tools** in your prompt
2. **Write handler functions** for each tool
3. **Parse model's tool requests**
4. **Execute appropriate code**
5. **Return results to model**
6. **Let model formulate final answer**

---

## **🤔 Decision Framework: When to Use Tools**

### **Use Tools When:**

- ✅ Need real-time data
- ✅ Accessing external APIs
- ✅ Performing calculations
- ✅ Querying databases
- ✅ Executing actions

### **Don't Use Tools When:**

- ❌ Answer is in training data
- ❌ Simple conversational response
- ❌ General knowledge questions
- ❌ Creative writing tasks

---

## **⚡ Quick Summary**

```
PROBLEM: model can't access current/private data
SOLUTION: Give model "tools" to fetch external info

HOW IT WORKS:
1. You tell model about available tools
2. model requests specific tool use
3. YOUR code executes the tool
4. Results go back to model
5. model gives informed answer

ANALOGY:
model = Smart assistant without internet
Tools = Letting assistant use your phone to Google things
```

## **🎓 The Big Picture**

**Without Tools:** model is like a **walking encyclopedia** - knows a lot but can't check today's news.

**With Tools:** model becomes a **research assistant with internet access** - can look up anything current.

**Your Role:** You're the **librarian** who shows model which "reference books" (tools) are available and fetches them when asked.
