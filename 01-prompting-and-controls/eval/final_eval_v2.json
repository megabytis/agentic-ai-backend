However, it's overly restrictive for modern email standards and would reject many valid email addresses due to limitations in allowed TLD characters (only 2+ letters) and special characters in the username. It also doesn't consider IDNs. While it fulfills the 'standard email format' loosely, it's not robust for real-world applications."
