While it perfectly fulfills the literal request, it's not a 'real-world' AWS web server configuration (like for an EC2 user data script, Elastic Beanstalk, or NGINX/Apache on EC2) as it's missing service-specific context and necessary details for SSL implementation. However, for a generic JSON representation of the requested parameters, it is excellent."

    "reasoning": "The provided regex is a good practical solution for many common email validation scenarios. It correctly identifies the basic structure of an email (local-part@domain) and uses common character sets. However, it is not a fully RFC-compliant validator, as email addresses can be significantly more complex (e.g., quoted local parts, IP literal domains, internationalized domains and local parts). For typical web form validation, it's often 'good enough', but for strict compliance or handling all possible valid emails, it falls short."
