      "No explicit handling for non-integer types in the input list, which could lead to runtime errors."

The only minor improvement would be to add robustness against potential non-numeric inputs, although the prompt did not explicitly require this.",

    ],
    "reasoning": "The solution accurately captures the requested settings in a basic JSON format. However, as an 'AWS code reviewer,' its primary weakness is the complete absence of AWS context. It doesn't adhere to any specific AWS service's configuration schema (e.g., CloudFormation, EC2 user data, ALB listener rules, Amplify.yml). It's a generic JSON representation, not an AWS-specific configuration.",

      "Does not fully conform to RFC standards for email addresses.",
      "Lacks support for newer TLDs and internationalized domain names (IDN)."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The provided regex is a good practical solution for matching most common email addresses encountered in everyday use. It correctly identifies the local-part, the '@' symbol, and a basic domain structure with a two-character or more TLD. However, it's not a complete RFC-compliant email regex, which is notoriously complex. Specifically, it misses many valid characters in the local-part (e.g., '!', '#', '$', '&', etc.), quoted strings, IP address domains, and newer/longer TLDs. For typical form validation, it's often sufficient, but for strict adherence to email standards or handling edge cases, it falls short.",
