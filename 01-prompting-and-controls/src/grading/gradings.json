    "strengths": [
      "Correctness and readability: The solution accurately calculates the sum of even numbers and is easy to understand.",
      "Type hints: Python type hints are used, improving code clarity and maintainability."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "No specific AWS context: The solution is a general Python function and doesn't leverage any AWS services or best practices.",
      "Potential for minor performance optimization: For very large lists, a generator expression with sum() could be marginally more memory efficient."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The provided solution is perfectly functional, correct, and follows good Python practices for a standalone function. However, as an 'AWS expert code reviewer' tasked with evaluating an 'AI-generated solution' where the original task had no AWS context, the primary 'weakness' is the lack of any AWS-specific elements. This isn't a fault of the solution itself, but rather a reflection of the task's lack of AWS relevance. For a pure Python context, it's excellent. From an AWS perspective, there's nothing to review.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Lacks context for a specific AWS service or standard web server configuration.",
      "The JSON structure is generic and not tied to any specific AWS resource type (e.g., EC2 userdata, CloudFormation template, ECS task definition)."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The solution accurately captures all requested parameters in a valid JSON format. However, as an 'AWS code reviewer', its main weakness is that it's a completely generic JSON object and doesn't align with any specific AWS service's configuration schema (e.g., an EC2 user-data script, an ALB listener rule, an ECS container definition, a CloudFormation resource property). While syntactically correct and semantically matching the request, it's not directly usable within a typical AWS deployment without further context or wrapping in an AWS-specific configuration language.",

    "strengths": [
      "Covers basic email address structures accurately.",
      "Correctly handles common special characters in the local part and subdomains."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Does not conform to RFC standards for email address validation.",
      "Excludes valid characters (e.g., in subdomains like `_`, international characters) and allows some invalid patterns."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The provided regex is a good effort for common email patterns but is not comprehensive and deviates from RFC standards. It's suitable for simple UI validation but would fail to match many valid emails and could incorrectly validate some invalid ones according to official specifications. For robust validation, a more complex regex or a dedicated email validation library is required.",
