      "2. Guide the snake to eat the red food blocks.\n",
      "3. The snake grows longer each time it eats food.\n",

      "5. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Requirements:\n",
      "- Python 3.x\n",
      "- Pygame library (install with `pip install pygame`)\n",
      "\n",
      "### Features:\n",
      "- Simple grid-based movement\n",
      "- Snake grows when eating food\n",
      "- Random food generation\n",
      "- Collision detection (walls and self)\n",
      "- Score tracking (implicit - length of snake)\n",
      "\n",
      "To run the game:\n",
      "1. Save the code in a file named `snake_game.py`\n",
      "2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`\n",
      "3. Run the script: `python snake_game.py`\n",
      "\n",
      "The game window will open, and you can immediately start playing with the arrow keys. The snake is green, food is red, and the background is black. The game runs at 10 frames per second, which you can adjust by changing the FPS constant.\n"
