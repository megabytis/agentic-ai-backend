    "weaknesses": [
      "Completely missed the original task: 'sum of all even numbers in a list'. The solution provided is for calculating factorials.",
      "The example usage includes commented-out sections, which is not ideal for a final solution presented for review."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated solution is technically sound for calculating factorials, demonstrating good coding practices like input validation, docstrings, and clear explanations. However, it entirely fails to address the prompt's actual requirement, which was to sum even numbers in a list. This fundamental mismatch makes the solution unusable for the original task. While the factorial solution itself is well-written, it's irrelevant to the prompt.",

    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failed to meet all specific requirements of the original task, particularly regarding enabling SSL and setting the root directory to '/var/www/html'.",
      "The solution is a generic web server configuration, not tailored to AWS services or specific AWS infrastructure components, which was implied by the 'AWS code reviewer' context."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated solution provides a very well-structured and thoroughly explained JSON configuration for a *generic* web server. It includes useful parameters beyond the request, such as logging and routing, which is a strength for completeness. However, it fails on two key aspects of the original prompt: `ssl_enabled` is set to `false` instead of `true`, and the `directory` for the static handler is `./public` instead of `/var/www/html`. Furthermore, as an 'AWS code reviewer', the solution doesn't leverage any AWS-specific constructs or common AWS web server patterns (e.g., EC2 user data, Elastic Beanstalk configuration, ECS task definitions, API Gateway integrations), making it less relevant in an AWS context.",

      "The solution provides a practical and commonly used regex for email validation, striking a good balance between strictness and usability.",
      "It offers a comprehensive explanation of each regex component, its pros and cons, and includes runnable example code, which greatly enhances understanding and practical application."
    ],
    "weaknesses": [
      "The regex could be slightly improved to disallow periods or hyphens at the beginning/end of domain labels, which are technically invalid in most contexts.",
      "While acknowledging IDN limitations, the solution doesn't offer a brief alternative or mention libraries that handle them, which might be useful for a broader audience."
    ],
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated solution is excellent. It provides a robust, well-explained regex that is suitable for most real-world applications. The detailed breakdown, including limitations and practical advice (like sending confirmation emails), demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem. The Python example code makes it immediately actionable. The weaknesses are minor enhancements rather than critical flaws, reflecting the inherent difficulty of 'perfect' email regex.",
