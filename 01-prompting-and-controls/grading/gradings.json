    "reasoning": "The AI-generated solution provides a well-written function to calculate the sum of even numbers, complete with excellent documentation and comprehensive test cases. However, it fails to meet the core requirement of the original task, which was to 'return a new list containing only the even numbers.' The solution calculates a sum instead of building and returning a list.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Option 1 incorrectly states that it allows consecutive dots in the local part, which it does not. `[._%+-]+` matches one or more of these characters, not a sequence of a dot then a different character then a dot.",

    ],
    "reasoning": "The AI-generated solution is excellent. It goes far beyond simply providing a regex by offering context, explaining the inherent complexities of email validation, and providing practical, well-explained options. The discussion of RFC compliance vs. practicality, client-side vs. server-side validation, and length limits demonstrates a deep understanding. The only minor issues are a slight misstatement in the explanation of Option 1's local part matching and a general mention of RFCs without specific numbers.",
