## Token
Subword unit of text. Models process and charge per token. ~4 chars = 1 token (English avg).

## Context Window
Max tokens (input + output) a model can handle in one request. Gemini 2.5 Flash = 1M tokens.

## Stateless
Model has no memory between API calls. Each request is independent.

## LLM (Large Language Model)
Pre-trained model that predicts next tokens based on input. Not "thinking"—pattern matching.
